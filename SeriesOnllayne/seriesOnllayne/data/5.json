The Flash: Season 3 Critics Consensus: The Flash shifts focus in its third season, turning from the grandiose and bizarre toward the characters who inhabit its core universe -- all while remaining action-packed, funny, and dramatic. The Flash: Season 2 Critics Consensus: The Flash remains one of the strongest comic book shows on television. The Flash: Season 1 Critics Consensus: The Flash benefits from its purposefully light atmosphere, making it a superhero show uniquely geared toward genre fans as well as novices.
