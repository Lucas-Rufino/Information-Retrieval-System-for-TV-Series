  "resume": "'The truth is out there,' and FBI agents Scully and Mulder seek it in this sci-fi phenomenon about their quest to explain the seemingly unexplainable. Their strange cases include UFO sightings, alien abductions and just about anything else paranormal. The tales were spooky and well-written, but the long-running cult favorite's strength was a gallery of intriguing (when they weren't just enigmatic) characters, and the dynamic---and intense bond---between believer Mulder and skeptic Scully.",
