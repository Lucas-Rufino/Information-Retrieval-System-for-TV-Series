They have three children; Cheche the eldest is 28, Esma the second daughter who is the star of the series and finally a son who is in his final year at school. Esma has loved Demir, the younger son, ever since she was a child but he never noticed her. She always followed his news in the magazines. One night she climbed a tree to watch the annual Spring party that his family was holding but her sister followed her and tried to force to come down from the tree resulting in her falling over the large cake and hurting her ankle. The next morning, Selim found her sitting in the garden of his house and discovered that her foot was hurting so he decided to take her to a doctor. Esma was going to audition that day for a dance but her father didn't know about it. She failed the audition because she couldn't dance well. One night Demir came home followed by one of his girlfriends who refused to leave and wanted to be invited inside. He told her that his girlfriend was there and so he couldn't receive her.
