Grace was sentenced to life imprisonment, and became one of the most enigmatic and notorious women of 1840s Canada for her supposed role in the sensational double murder. Eventually exonerated after 30 years in jail, her conviction was controversial and sparked much debate about whether she was involved in the murder, or was merely an unwitting accessory.", "cast": ["Sarah Gadon", "Edward Holcroft", "Rebecca Liddiard", "Zachary Levi", "Kerr Logan", "David Cronenberg", "Paul Gross", "Anna Paquin", "Alice Snaden", "Kate Ross", "Stephen Joffe", "Martha Burns", "Diane D'Aquila", "Elizabeth Saunders", "Mag Ruffman", "Jonathan Koensgen", "John Tench", "Samantha Weinstein", "Will Seatle Bowes", "Jonathan Goad", "Sarah Manninen", "Michael Therriault", "Christian Smith", "Sylvia Zuk", "Claire Armstrong"], "character": ["Grace Marks", "Dr. Simon Jordan", "Mary Whitney", "Jeremiah/Jerome Dupont", "James McDermott", "Reverend Verrenger", "Thomas Kinnear", "Nancy Montgomery", "Lydia", "Agnes", "Jamie Walsh", "Mrs. Parkinson", "Mrs. Quenell", "Mrs. Honey", "Diane", "Keeper #2", "Keepr #1", "Effie", "George Parkinson", "Grace's Father", "Mrs. Humphrey", "Mr. McDonald", "Orderly", "Immigrant", "Cook"]}
