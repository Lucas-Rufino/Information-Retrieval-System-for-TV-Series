View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  17 f A review by fcsuper  9.0 Written by  fcsuper  on June 11, 2017 Great ensemble cast and stories that captured high school life for the outcasts.  Though the setting was supposed to be 1980-ish, the writing never quiet pulls that off.  Believe it or not, something set in 1980 should feel more like the 1970's rather than stereotypical 80's.  However, in the case of this show, it actually feels more like early 1990's high school experience.  Even still, it's a great show that hits both the funny and the feels very well.
