Started by Thrasher magazine in 2003, it's a demented, roving adventure that follows various skate teams across the country as they compete to accomplish a set list of tasks, some of which carry great risk of bodily harm, and others that don't involve skateboarding at all (but still might carry great risk of bodily harm). VICELAND has teamed up with Thrasher for the latest season, which will feature the Birdhouse, Chocolate, and Toy Machine teams hauling ass across America, throwing their bodies and whatever dignity they might have had into the wind for a chance to become the reigning King of the Road.", "cast": ["Aaron Homoki", "Mike Davis", "Ben Raybourn", "Blake Carpenter", "Billy Marks", "Daniel Lutheran", "Axel Cruysberghs", "Raven Tershy", "Elijah Berle", "Stevie Perez", "Collin Provost", "Justin Eldridge", "Clive Dixon", "Clint Walker", "Johnny Jones"], "character": ["Aaron Homoki", "Mike Davis", "Ben Raybourn", "Blake Carpenter", "Billy Marks", "Daniel Lutheran", "Axel Cruysberghs", "Raven Tershy", "Elijah Berle", "Stevie Perez", "Collin Provost", "Justin Eldridge", "Clive Dixon", "Clint Walker", "Johnny Jones"]}
