SEASON 02: When I watched the first season when it was originally aired, it had some serious fan following, but I won't say it was very very famous at the time. Now, after the second season, seems everything has changed. Drastically the votings, rating, reviews have increased. IF one more season with similarly powerful characters, story comes out, then it surely would be among the greatest like 'Dexter', 'Breaking Bad' et cetera. I am confident it will go up to the seventh to set up a perfect finale in the next half decade. I did not review...  read the rest.
