View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  1 C A review by CourtneyM17  1.0 Written by  CourtneyM17  on August  2, 2017 I feel like this show tried too hard to be edgy. A majority of the show was boring and had uninteresting content. The main character is extremely unlikable and her motives for her actions don't make sense. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone I know.
