Every night, a group of up-and-coming comedians wait to perform at Goldie\u2019s, the hottest stand-up club in town. But first they\u2019ll have to win over Goldie, who rules the Sunset Strip with an iron fist. Stand-up is a drug for these comedians, and they\u2019re willing to sacrifice everything to get their fix. They brave the pain of sharing their innermost thoughts and darkest secrets, hoping that someone, anyone, will laugh.
