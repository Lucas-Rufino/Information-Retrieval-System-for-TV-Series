The Shadoks were bird-like in appearance, were characterised by ruthlessness and stupidity and inhabited a two dimensional planet. Another set of creatures in the Shadok canon are the Gibis, who are the opposite to the Shadoks in that they are intelligent but vulnerable and also inhabit a two-dimensional planet. Rouxel claims that the term Shadok obtains some derivation from Captain Haddock of Herg\u00e9's The Adventures of Tintin and the Gibis are essentially GBs. The Shadoks were a significant literary, cultural and philosophical phenomenon in France. Even today, the French occasionally use satirical comparisons with the Shadoks for policies and attitudes that they consider absurd. The Shadoks were noted for mottos such as: \u2055\"Why do it the easy way when you can do it the hard way?\" \u2055\"When one tries continuously, one ends up succeeding. Thus, the more one fails, the greater the chance that it will work.\" Featured Crew Jacques Rouxel Creator Discussions   Reviews Videos   Images   Changes Report Share Discussions General  0 Content Issues  0 Images Backdrops  3 Posters  2 Videos Trailers  0 Teasers  0 Clips  0 Featurettes  0 Opening Credits  0 Top Billed Cast Claude Pi\u00e9plu Narrateur Full Cast & Crew Last Season Season 4 2000 | 52 Episodes Season 4 of Les Shadoks premiered on January  1, 2000.
