The fast-paced, drama-filled docu-series follows six Charleston singles \u2014 Craig Conover, Cameran Eubanks, Jenna King, Thomas Ravenel, Shepard \"Shep\" Rose, and Whitney Sudler Smith \u2014 struggling with the constraints of this tight-knit, posh society. The cast, some descendants of Vice Presidents and four-term Senators, and others from \"new money,\" is comprised of Southern bachelors who suffer from \"Peter Pan Syndrome\" by refusing to settle down; and the women in their lives who challenge them to grow up. Viewers will see them launch political careers, build businesses, break hearts, and chase true love -- all while struggling to preserve their family names. Because in Charleston, you're only as good as your last garden party and one social screw-up can taint generations to come.", "cast": [], "character": []}
