Leading the team is Special Agent Dwayne 'King' Pride, a native of New Orleans who is driven by his need to do what is right. Working with him is Special Agent Christopher LaSalle, who plays hard but works harder; and Special Agent Meredith 'Merri' Brody, a charismatic and tough interrogator who transferred from the Great Lakes office in search of a fresh start. Supporting them is coroner, Dr. Loretta Wade, who is as eccentric as she is smart. This colorful city that harbors a dark side is a magnet for service personnel on leave, and when overindulgence is followed by trouble, Pride's team is at its best.", "cast": ["Scott Bakula", "Lucas Black", "Rob Kerkovich", "CCH Pounder", "Vanessa Ferlito", "Shalita Grant"], "character": ["Dwayne Pride", "Christopher LaSalle", "Sebastian Lund", "Dr. Loretta Wade", "Tammy Gregorio", "Sonja Percy"]}
