You can help by rating TV shows you've seen. Facts Status  In Production Network Certification 15 Meaning This rating is for programs that contain material that may be inappropriate for children under 15, and that parental discretion should be used. Examples include most dramas, and talk shows on OTA (over-the-air) TV (KBS, MBC, SBS), and many American TV shows/dramas on Cable TV channels like OCN and OnStyle. The programs that have this rating may include moderate or strong adult themes, language, sexual inference, and violence. As with the TV-MA rating in North America, this rating is commonly applied to live events where the occurrence of inappropriate dialogue is unpredictable. Since 2007, this rating is the most used rating for TV.
