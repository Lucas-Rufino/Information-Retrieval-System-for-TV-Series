The original term and the accompanying language came during a meal Peyo was having with his colleague and friend Andr\u00e9 Franquin at the Belgian Coast. Having momentarily forgotten the word \"salt\", Peyo asked him (in French) to pass the schtroumpf. Franquin jokingly replied: \"Here's the Schtroumpf \u2014 when you are done schtroumpfing, schtroumpf it back...\" and the two spent the rest of that weekend speaking in \"schtroumpf language\". The name was later translated into Dutch as Smurf, which was adopted in English.", "cast": ["Frank Welker", "Michael Bell", "Danny Goldman", "Paul Winchell", "William Callaway", "June Foray", "Don Messick", "Lucille Bliss", "Hamilton Camp"], "character": ["Hefty Smurf (voice)", "Handy Smurf (voice)", "Brainy Smurf (voice)", "Gargamel (voice)", "Clumsy Smurf (voice)", "Jokey Smurf (voice)", "Papa Smurf (voice)", "Smurfette (voice)", "Greedy Smurf (voice)"]}
