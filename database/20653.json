The sole responsibility of the special task force is to find missing persons by applying advanced psychological profiling techniques to peel back the layers of the victims' lives and trace their whereabouts in an effort to discover whether they have been abducted, been murdered, committed suicide or simply run away. The team reconstructs a \"Day of Disappearance\" timeline that details every minute of the 24 hours prior to the disappearance, following one simple rule: learn who the victim is in order to learn where the victim is. Senior agent Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia) heads the dedicated team that knows too well that every second counts when someone vanishes.", "cast": ["Poppy Montgomery", "Roselyn S\u00e1nchez", "Enrique Murciano", "Anthony LaPaglia", "Eric Close", "Marianne Jean-Baptiste", "Darcy Rose Byrnes", "Marc Jablon"], "character": ["Samantha Spade", "Elena Delgado", "", "Jack Malone", "Martin Fitzgerald", "", "", "Adam Miller"]}
