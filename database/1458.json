View All Seasons Social Reviews  2 Discussions  0 A review by Baz  6.0 Written by  Baz  on May  9, 2018 Killing Eve is mediocre at best. Some very far-fetched plot holes.\nThe acting is very weak and hammy at times . After watching 4 episodes I started asking myself \u2018Why am I watching this? And couldn\u2019t answer it!\u2019 There\u2019s better ways to waste time!
