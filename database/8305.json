View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  0 A review by spookytoots Written by  spookytoots  on June 25, 2017 Although only lasting for one season, this show had a lasting impact on all Jim Henson fans. From giving us a look at the behind the scenes, to giving birth to the fabulous Story Teller series, this show jumped from musical numbers, to social commentary, to silly off the wall fun without missing a beat.
