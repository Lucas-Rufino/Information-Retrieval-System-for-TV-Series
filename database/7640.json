View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  0 A review by Mr. Moovee Written by  Mr. Moovee  on February 28, 2018 Watched the Pilot on 50Cent Facebook feed, Pretty good premiere, sorta gritty like The Shield and Gang Related (surprisely) cancelled) A few well known actors (Katrina Law (Spartacus) , Ryan Kwanten( True Blood) to name a few.  The only thing I didn't like was the shaky cameras. I get the look the director is going for trying to make it seem live but in this case, it's overused and often made me dizzy.   When the rest of the season is released in March I will have more to write.  I love Crackle's other crime show (Startup) so  I'm hoping this one can live up to that show.
