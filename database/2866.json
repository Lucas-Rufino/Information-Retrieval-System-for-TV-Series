View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  4 D A review by DavidLinck85  10.0 Written by  DavidLinck85  on August  9, 2017 There were a lot of great kids show that came on in the 90s and a lot of them were on Nickelodeon. In my opinion Are You Afraid of the Dark was one of the all-time greatest shows ever for kids because it had great story telling, great prodution value that still hilds up today. The stories that were on Are You Afraid of the Dark were extreamly creepy even for a kids show, also a lot of great actors got their start on this show. So if you love a great spooky and creepy horror anthology show for kids then I recommend Are You Afraid of the Dark.
