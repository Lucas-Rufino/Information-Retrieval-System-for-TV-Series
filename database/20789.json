Bolstered by a soundtrack that beautifully evokes the '80s, the show chronicles the life of the young Chris, whose family's penny-pinching is leavened by love (and laughs). At home, Chris helps care for his younger brother and sister, while at school he's often the target of a racist bully.", "cast": ["Tyler James Williams", "Terry Crews", "Tequan Richmond", "Imani Hakim", "Jacqueline Mazarella", "Tichina Arnold", "Vincent Martella", "Holly Weber", "Kevontay Jackson", "Travis T.
