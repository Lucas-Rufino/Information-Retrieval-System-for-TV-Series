This new arrangement will land Lena and Martin in some precarious situations, with Lena\u2019s doting sensibilities and Type-A personality clashing with Martin\u2019s laid-back temperament as they attempt to raise the kids separately but together. What will Lena and Martin do with their unfamiliar moments of freedom? And how will they manage their feelings when this freedom is met with the nostalgia for what they once shared as a couple and their mutual longing for their family to be whole again? With the help of friends Arthur and Camille, plus Lena\u2019s sister, Maya, this former couple will explore what it means to live apart...under the same roof.", "cast": ["Jenna Fischer", "Oliver Hudson", "Bobby Lee", "Diane Farr", "Lindsay Price", "Olivia Keville", "Van Crosby", "Sander Thomas"], "character": ["Lena", "Martin", "Arthur", "Maya", "Camille", "Mae", "Mason", "Milo"]}
