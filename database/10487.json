The show follows the life of a dysfunctional Polish family from Wroc\u0142aw, who live in an old apartment in Wroc\u0142aw on 3/4 \u0106wiartki street. Most episodes are centered on Ferdynand Kiepski, who tries to make various schemes to improve his financial or life situation, all of which ultimately fail. The series parodies the dynamics of Polish families in a style similar to that of the US series Married with Children, released in Poland as \u015awiat wed\u0142ug Bundych; in many ways it inverts the dynamics of the Bundys. In many ways it is also inspired by The Simpsons. It is the third longest comedy TV series in the world after The Simpsons and The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet.\nDirector: Patrick Yoka", "rate": 53, "genre": [], "cast": [], "character": [], "site_data": "html Apps Forums Leaderboard Contribute API Support Discover Movies TV Shows Movies Popular Top Rated Upcoming Now Playing TV Shows Popular Top Rated On TV Airing Today People Popular People Can't find a movie or TV show?
