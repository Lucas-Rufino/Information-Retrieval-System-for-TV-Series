She lives with her twenty-something brother/guardian Spencer and produces her Web casts from a makeshift third-floor loft studio. Grappling with adolescence, she never aimed to gain fame as a rising star/underground celebrity to kids. As events unfold in the pilot, it all happens by accident when a teacher puts her in charge of the school talent show. She and her sassy best bud Sam turn the audition process into a show, which Carly's tech savvy smitten friend Freddy tapes -- including their hilarious banter and great chemistry -- and posts on the Web without telling the girls. The on-line audience clamors for more, and a pop phenomenon blooms, with Carly and sidekick Sam's regular Web casts ultimately featuring everything from comedy sketches and talent contests to interviews, recipes, and problem-solving.", "cast": ["Miranda Cosgrove", "Jennette McCurdy", "Nathan Kress", "Jerry Trainor", "Aeryk Bacon", "Spencer List", "Johan Archiles"], "character": ["Carly Shay", "Sam Puckett", "Freddie Benson", "Spencer Shay", "Aeryk Bacon", "", "Julian"]}
