View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  1 A review by Baz  7.0 Written by  Baz  on April 12, 2018 Marcella was a series that I was a little apprehensive to watch for some reason but I must admit that it pleasantly surprised me.\nIt was your run of the mill formula series. It had some very good writing and the characters were very believable, probably cause they weren\u2019t that likable in their roles.\nIt was a nice break from your Hollywood engine of series that come off a conveyer belt.\nSo it had good merit.  Although I\u2019d hope they leave the series at two seasons as that could probably kill it.
