The zombies, colloquially referred to as \"walkers\", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them; they are attracted to noise, such as gunshots, and to different scents, e.g. humans. Humans that they bite or scratch become infected and slowly turn into walkers as well. It is revealed early in the series that all living humans carry this pathogen, so that if they die from any other cause, they will also turn into walkers. The only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain or otherwise fully destroy the body, such as by cremating it.", "cast": ["Andrew Lincoln", "Norman Reedus", "Lauren Cohan", "Danai Gurira", "Christian Serratos", "Melissa McBride", "Chandler Riggs", "Jeffrey Dean Morgan"], "character": ["Rick Grimes", "Daryl Dixon", "Maggie Greene", "Michonne", "Rosita Espinosa", "Carol Peletier", "Carl Grimes", "Negan"]}
