There\u2019s this girl at school, Yamada, who wants to make like a hundred sex friends. She totally thinks she can devirginize one hundred different boys! Can you believe that? That\u2019s like every boy in the school. Who does she think she is? I heard from my friend\u2019s neighbor\u2019s cousin\u2019s lab partner that Yamada\u2019s never even been kissed.  Oh. My. God. I would totally die. That\u2019s like burn all your makeup and shave off your eyebrows embarrassing. I can\u2019t even think about it. Today at lunch I saw Yamada flirting, like for reals flirting, with that geek Kosuda. You know the guy. Photography club, no muscles, boring face, kind of reminds you of a black-and-white movie. Super lame. If Yamada can\u2019t even make the sex with him, she\u2019ll never score a hundred cherry boys. She needs to take like Sex Ed or something because I heard she can\u2019t give it away!", "rate": 75, "genre": ["Animation", "Comedy"], "cast": ["Kana Hanazawa", "Atsushi Abe", "Yukari Tamura", "Asami Shimoda", "Brittney Karbowski"], "character": ["Mayu Miyano", "Takashi Kosuda", "Yamada", "Chika Yamada", "Yamada (English Dub)"], "site_data": "html Apps Forums Leaderboard Contribute API Support Discover Movies TV Shows Movies Popular Top Rated Upcoming Now Playing TV Shows Popular Top Rated On TV Airing Today People Popular People Can't find a movie or TV show?
