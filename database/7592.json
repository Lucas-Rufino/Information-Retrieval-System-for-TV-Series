(2011) User Score Overview When you've got acute gynophobia, even a pretty girl can be like a malady, and as the sparring partner for his family of female wrestlers, Sakamachi Kinjiro has the worst case ever! Just one touch makes his nose bleed, so school's a bloody nightmare even before Kanade, the principal's twisted daughter, deduces both Kinjiro's \"feminine issue\" and that his name contains the sounds \"Chi\" and \"Kin\" back to back. But Chi-Kinjiro's female troubles don't totally redline until a wrong turn in the men's room exposes the secret Subaru, Kanade's manservant, has been hiding in the water closet. (Well, to be fair, SHE is still a servant.) If Subaru's cross reactions concerning her cross-dressing aren't enough of a drag, Kinjiro's girl problems also include a haunted martial artist (with ghosts), a cat-eared fetishist (meow!), and his own sister, who's interest in \"wrestling\" a certain incorrectly packaged butler may result in an unexpected ending!
