{"title": "The Affair", "link": "https://trakt.tv/shows/the-affair", "genre": ["Drama"], "rate": 78, "resume": "At once deeply observed and intriguingly elusive, The Affair explores the emotional effects of an extramarital relationship. Noah is a New York City schoolteacher and novelist who is happily married, but resents his dependence on his wealthy father-in-law. Alison is a young waitress trying to piece her life and marriage back together in the wake of a tragedy. Set in Montauk at the end of Long Island, the provocative drama unfolds separately from both the male and female perspectives, using the distinct memory biases of both to tell the story.", "cast": ["Dominic West", "Ruth Wilson", "Maura Tierney", "Joshua Jackson", "Julia Goldani Telles", "Jake Siciliano", "Jadon Sand", "Leya Catlett"], "character": ["Noah Solloway", "Alison Bailey", "Helen Solloway", "Cole Lockhart", "Whitney Solloway", "Martin Solloway", "Trevor Solloway", "Stacey Solloway"]}
