When he's not getting on the nerves of his cranky next door neighbor Squidward, SpongeBob can usually be found smack in the middle of all sorts of strange situations with his best buddy, the simple yet lovable starfish, Patrick, or his thrill-seeking surfer-girl squirrel pal, Sandy Cheeks.", "cast": ["Bill Fagerbakke", "Carolyn Lawrence", "Tom Kenny", "Clancy Brown", "Rodger Bumpass"], "character": ["Patrick Star (voice)", "Sandy Cheeks (voice)", "SpongeBob Squarepants (voice)", "Mr. Krabs (voice)", "Squidward (voice)"]}
