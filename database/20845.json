{"title": "Relic Hunter", "link": "https://trakt.tv/shows/relic-hunter", "genre": ["Mystery", "Action", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "rate": 70, "resume": "Relic Hunter follows the globe-trotting adventures of unorthodox American archaeologist Sydney Fox (Carrere) and her more reserved British assistant Nigel Bailey (Anholt). They are assisted at their 'home base,' a generic American university identified only as Trinity College, by ditzy student secretary Claudia (Booth), the spoiled and fashion-conscious daughter of one of the college's major donors. The character of Claudia was replaced in the third season by Karen Petrushky (Reichert), who is closer to the standard 'sexy secretary' stereotype but with an impressive facility for predicaments of a bureaucratic nature. Some fans have interpreted this as a network attempt to enhance the sex appeal of the series which instead contributed to its ultimate cancellation at the close of the third season.", "cast": ["Tia Carrere", "Christien Anholt", "Lindy Booth", "Tanja Reichert", "Malin \u00c5kerman"], "character": ["Sydney Fox", "Nigel Bailey", "Claudia", "", "Elena"]}
