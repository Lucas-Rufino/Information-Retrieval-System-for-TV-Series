In the past 10 years, he\u2019s successfully turned around over 100 companies. Now he\u2019s bringing those skills to CNBC and doing something no one has ever done on TV before \u2026 he\u2019s putting millions of dollars of his own money on the line. In each episode, Lemonis makes an offer that\u2019s impossible to refuse; his cash for a piece of the business and a percentage of the profits. And once inside these companies, he\u2019ll do almost anything to save the business and make himself a profit; even if it means firing the president, promoting the secretary or doing the work himself.
