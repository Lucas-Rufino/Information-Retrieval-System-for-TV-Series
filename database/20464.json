Al Bundy, shoe salesman, fears the frequent amorous advances of his ditsy wife Peggy, who henpecks him and frivolously spends most of his wages. Supporting characters include their two shallow, self-serving teenage children Kelly and Bud, as well as nosy neighbor Marcy and her husband.", "cast": ["Ed O'Neill", "Katey Sagal", "Christina Applegate", "David Faustino", "Amanda Bearse", "Ted McGinley"], "character": ["Al Bundy", "Peggy Bundy", "Kelly Bundy", "Bud Bundy", "Marcy D'Arcy", "Jefferson D'Arcy"]}
