The beauty of Nip/Tuck is that it goes deeper, laying bare the complexities and fragile natures often found in patients seeking cosmetic surgery.

The series' cutting-edge stories range from funny to suspenseful to uncommonly powerful. The surgeries are graphically bold. The sexuality is rampant.", "cast": ["Dylan Walsh", "Julian McMahon", "Joely Richardson", "John Hensley", "Roma Maffia", "Kelly Carlson"], "character": ["Sean McNamara", "Christian Troy", "Julia McNamara", "Matt McNamara", "Liz Cruz", "Kimber Henry"]}
