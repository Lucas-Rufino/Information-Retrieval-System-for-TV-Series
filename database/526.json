Macy and Emmy Rossum star in this fiercely engaging and fearlessly twisted series. Chicagoan Frank Gallagher is the proud single dad of six smart, industrious, independent kids, who without him would be...perhaps better off.

They may not be like any family you know, but they make no apologies for being exactly who they are.", "cast": ["William H.
