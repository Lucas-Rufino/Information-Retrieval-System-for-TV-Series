View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  11 a A review by avivg  10.0 Written by  avivg  on September 26, 2017 One of the best TV-shows of all time.\nThis war series is one of the most realistic,  accurate, detailed and comprehensive I've ever encountered.\nThe show is overwhelming, intriguing and some episodes can squeeze a couple of tears from you.\nOne of the few series that stuck in your head even a week after you've finish them.\nHighly recommended.
