View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  0 D A review by DavidLinck85  10.0 Written by  DavidLinck85  on August  9, 2017 The Adventures of Pete and Pete was one of the all-time great shows of my childhood. It was a classic 90s show that had lots of heart, adventures, quirky/zany characters, and lots of great music that shapped the 90s. Nowadays you cant find kids shows like The Adventures of Pete and Pete anymore because channels like Nickelodeon suck now. So if you are a 90s kid like me all hail the strongest man in the world.
