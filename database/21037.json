By their side on many adventures are best friend Chloe (the only human character in the cast), fame-obsessed koala Nom Nom, and Charlie, aka Bigfoot.", "cast": ["Jason Lee", "Eric Edelstein", "Patton Oswalt", "Bobby Moynihan", "Charlyne Yi", "Demetri Martin", "Sam Lavagnino", "Cameron Esposito", "Duncan Joiner"], "character": ["Charlie (voice)", "Grizzly (voice)", "Nom Nom (voice)", "Panda (voice)", "Chloe (voice)", "Ice Bear (voice)", "Baby Grizzly", "Ranger Tabes", "Baby Panda"]}
