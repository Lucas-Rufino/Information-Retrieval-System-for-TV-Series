I myself have watched a bit of the 1994 original but do not recall anything of it aside from what I summarized in the sentence before. Therefore, I am unable to review Tawee Pope in comparison to its predecessor. When news came out of its remake, I was thrilled at the general storyline of \u201ctwo worlds\u201d bringing together two soul mates [more because of Om!], then disappointed that Pancake was the nang\u2019ek, and as I watched it, I clearly became disappointed. Fans bashed the remake calling it an epic failure. I agree. Godninja boldy rates Tawee Pope with 2 stars.\nSince Tawee Pope lacked in the goodness department, I must mention my top five scenes: 1. [Scenes in this case] Whenever Khun Luang managed to crack smile or roll his eyes. If not for you, I would have been long gone. 2. Khun Luang (or was it Manee?) meekly confessed he likes her and they held hands. Such a little thing, but it was so cute. At this point, I was just begging for any hint of romance! 3. Khun Laung hugged Manee back when the mirror called her to return. After the first time, he was a selfish bastard. 4. Om Akapan took off this shirt for me!

So freaking jealous!\nI think that is all the nice stuff I can say about Tawee Pope, so there comes the hating. Number one thing that this lakorn killed was\u2026it\u2019s whole purpose. And if you don\u2019t have a purpose, then you automatically fail. Simple as that. There was no significance to the time-traveling. There was no focus on the historical events which I thought was the point of Tawee Pope. The idea of Manee as a weapon of trickery to coax intelligence from the foreigners had so many possibility of epic plotline. Even though she manged to extract the \u2018valuable\u2019 info, they never showed how it was significant. Perhaps how it was used to counteract the imperialism or anything, really!\nFew more notable things to diss: Though according to character, Pancake over-acted, and even my Om bored me.

Mirror mirror on the wall, why can you let Manee bring in electric shavers but not a book. You want her to changed history, but you also limit her. This is the paradigm of time-traveling. And Manee, if you couldn\u2019t bring the one important book, why the heck didn\u2019t you just read it and remember it. I thought you were smart? Oh, I can\u2019t forget the lack of romance.
