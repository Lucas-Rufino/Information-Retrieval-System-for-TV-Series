View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  2 A review by Andres Gomez  5.0 Written by  Andres Gomez  on November 12, 2012 Stephen King's version of his own Novel. Clearly addressed for the TV. The cast is not really good, although the father performs well when he is drunk and scary. The story is more explained and easier to follow than in Kubrick's. Interesting, but not a moview to watch twice.
