  "resume": "Nostalgia Critic is a comedy webseries created, written, edited by, and starring Chicago native Doug Walker. The series initially launched on YouTube in 2007 before moving to independent sites That Guy with the Glasses and Blip.tv. The show follows the titular Nostalgia Critic, a bitter and sarcastic film critic, as he reviews movies and television shows from his childhood and recent past, usually with comically exaggerated rage. The show often alternates the Critic's angry rants and juvenile humor with legitimate analysis of the episode's subject.\nWalker briefly retired the series at the end of 2012 to work on other projects, even writing the character out of existence in the Channel Awesome film To Boldly Flee. However, on January 22, 2013, Walker announced the show's imminent return in a narrative video called \"The Review Must Go On\". The more sketch-heavy sixth season began on February 5, 2013 with a review of the film The Odd Life of Timothy Green.",
