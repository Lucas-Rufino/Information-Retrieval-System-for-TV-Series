In France, the series was broadcast on France 3 and rebroadcast on 13th Street. It is a police drama and follows the adventures of Peter Siska and later Victor Siska.\nAnyway it wasn't the best surname for a policeman because in some languages word \"Siska\" has extremely close meaning to \"Boob\" or \"Tit\". So you'll never see this series on, for example, Russian television. Croatian Radiotelevision has however shown the series, despite 'Siska' having the same meaning in the Croatian language",
