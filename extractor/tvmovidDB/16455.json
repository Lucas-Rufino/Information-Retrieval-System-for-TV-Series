Described by the BBC as a 'generation-gap comedy', it starred George Cole as Brian Hook, Kevin McNally as his son Alan Hook, and Toby Ross-Bryant as his son Vincent Hook and Julia Hills as his wife Beryl Hook.

For example, in 'Dadmestic', Vincent's mother allows him to host a house party, leaving Alan with no alternative but to spend the evening at his father's house.
