Told in his own words from hours of archived interviews, along with commentary from those closest to him, the documentary weaves the music and images from Sinatra\u2019s life together with rarely seen footage of his famous 1971 \u201cRetirement Concert\u201d in Los Angeles. The film\u2019s narrative is shaped by Sinatra\u2019s song choices for that concert, which Gibney interprets as the singer\u2019s personal guide through his own life.",
