But while THE WIRE has some of the most fascinating characters in tv and film (alot because most of them are based on real people) this series has some of the most blandest characters in a series in recent memory. I usually don't mind the cast (the ones I know of, never heard of the woman before) but here they are rather dull and incredibly emotionless. 4 episodes and then I gave up, there are so many series I want to watch out there so why continue with one...  read the rest.
