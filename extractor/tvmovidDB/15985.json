She is best friend's with Supadun so she forces him to be the father of the baby. Supadun is not pleased with her decision to take the baby in and he thinks they should give the baby to the police, they call the baby Tu Nu. But later he wants to be Lan's real lover but she's not ready to be anyone's wife yet. They bicker a lot but they're also lovey dovey too.\nThe plot will revolve around the struggles of adoption and the feeling of conflict that adoptive parents face when the child is not biologically theirs. Some feel that you cannot love another child the same if he/she is not biologically yours. Hence the title, \"Love Must be Carried.\" The saying is that a mother's love for a child that she had carried for 9 months is greater than her love for an adopted child since they aren't blood related. However, this lakorn will probably prove that wrong because Lanta and Supadun will be able to show that a child doesn't have to be biologically yours for you to fully love with all your heart.",
