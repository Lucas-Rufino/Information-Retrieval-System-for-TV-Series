The series consists of twenty-one 60-minute Polish language episodes, divided into five seasons - filmed in 1976, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 1987. It combines elements of action film and police procedural genres.\nDirected by Krzysztof Szmagier, it centres around the investigations of Police Lieutenant S\u0142awomir Borewicz. Each episode features a different case being solved by Borewicz. The series was loosely based on a novel series Ewa wzywa 07. The title of both the novels and the TV series refers to \"O-Seven\", a police radio call-sign used by Borewicz.\nDespite being widely considered a work of propaganda aimed at warming the image of \"Citizen's Militia\", the series proved highly popular in Poland and even gained a cult following. Critics consider it \"one of the biggest achievements of Polish crime drama\" the \"raw and realist response to >silly< Bond\", and \"the most popular Polish police series ever\". While taking place in Poland of the 1970s and 1980s, the series featured many elements of western lifestyle, mostly unavailable to ordinary Poles.
