The cast also included Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn as their superior, Lt. Virginia Cooper, and Lauren V\u00e9lez, who joined the cast in the second season as Nina Moreno, fellow detective and love interest to Torres. New York Undercover was created and produced by Dick Wolf, and its storyline takes place in the same fictional universe as Wolf's NBC series Law & Order and its spin-offs.\nNew York Undercover is notable for being the first police drama on American television to feature two people of color in the starring roles.
