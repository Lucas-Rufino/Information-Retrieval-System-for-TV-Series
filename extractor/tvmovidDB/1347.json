View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  16 A review by RoidDroidVoid  3.0 Written by  RoidDroidVoid  on July 23, 2017 After watching the first 5 episodes, I just can't take any more.  This show is absolutely horrible.  From the completely ridiculous decisions made by the characters throughout to the uninteresting and poorly written drama, this show needs to be put out of it's misery (no pun intended).\nI hate the characters.  I don't care to know anyone's backstory.  The acting is uninspired.  The story is a re-hash of a re-hash and, even then, the main story takes a back seat to the contrived nonsense meant to inform us about the characters.  Even though the writers are brutal and relentless in their quest to...  read the rest.
