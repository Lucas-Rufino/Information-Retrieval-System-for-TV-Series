Long nights with nothing to do but watch and wait, and spin a yarn or two... or, in the case of these over-caffeinated, sleep-deprived souls, share way too much information about themselves, opine on matters far beyond their qualifications, and discuss topics that most would agree are strictly NSFW.",
