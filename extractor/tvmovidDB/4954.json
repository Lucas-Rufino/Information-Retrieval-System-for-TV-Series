  "resume": "The Adventures of Pete & Pete is an American children's television series produced by Wellsville Pictures and broadcast by Nickelodeon. The show featured humorous and surreal elements in its narrative, and many recurring themes centered on two brothers both named Pete Wrigley, and their various interactions with family, friends, and enemies.\nThe show was created by Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi and began as minute-long shorts in 1989 that aired in between regular programs.

The N aired reruns of the show between 2002\u20132003. The first two seasons were released on DVD in 2005; the third was planned for 2006 but was indefinitely postponed.\nJason Ankeny of Allmusic called the series \"the greatest children's show ever,\" while IGN called it \"One of the most well-written kids shows ever.\"",

View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  0 D A review by DavidLinck85  10.0 Written by  DavidLinck85  on August  9, 2017 The Adventures of Pete and Pete was one of the all-time great shows of my childhood. It was a classic 90s show that had lots of heart, adventures, quirky/zany characters, and lots of great music that shapped the 90s. Nowadays you cant find kids shows like The Adventures of Pete and Pete anymore because channels like Nickelodeon suck now. So if you are a 90s kid like me all hail the strongest man in the world.
