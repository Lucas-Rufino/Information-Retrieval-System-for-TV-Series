If you're obsessed with zombie lore and the idea of watching the long-term effects spanning years at a time on an entire cast of characters, then this show is for you. There are a lot of scary parts with zombies eating and the gore and visual effects are award winning, but the show is mostly how people get along with each other during an apocalyptic setting and how they rebuild civilization or just live moment to moment.
