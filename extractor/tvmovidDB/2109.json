Determined to see that the beat goes on, Ritsu can get a little help from her friend Mio Akiyama on bass, and together they might be able to convince choir-inclined Tsumugi Kotobuki to join on the keyboards. But even then, they'll still need a hero, preferably of the juke-box variety with stars in her eyes. Instead they find Yui Hirasawa, who's looking for a club to join and who's never held a guitar in her life.

Because you can't stop the music when four girls share a dream, even if it's something as crazy as someday playing at the famous Budokan. It's going to be a long and winding road, but if they find their passion and follow their muse, they could go anywhere in K-ON!",
