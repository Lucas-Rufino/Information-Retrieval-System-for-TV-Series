  "resume": "This is Ch.3's biggest project as a Ch.3 40 years celebration. It's a lakorn serie consisting of 4 separate but intertwining lakorns: \"Thara Himalai\", \"Duangjai Akkanee\", \"Pathapee Leh Ruk\", and \"Wayupak Montra\". It is based from a series of 4 books by the same name and uses the same casts for all 4 lakorns.\nThe 4 lakorns can be separated into different pages, but I think it's better to leave them all in the same page because they're part of one single series.",
