The full 15-episode Season 1 is available on Netflix here in Europe. Access in the USA is via other paid services, at least on initial release, but American viewers might be able to catch up with this on Netflix if they travel.  Meanwhile all initial reviews are based on the pilot (episodes 1 and 2 combined).

There are some great ideas...  read the rest.
