View All Seasons Social Reviews  2 Discussions  22 A review by dgood826 Written by  dgood826  on June 30, 2017 I don\u2019t think this is the best episode of the Simpsons, it\u2019s not even in the period most consider the best seasons (4-8), but it\u2019s my favorite episode. It perfectly encapsulates what made the Simpsons amazing in the 90s: right amount of heart, wacky but not balls to the wall, and integrating a celebrity without it seeming like the episode was one long promo for that celebrity \u2013 fully understand the irony of that because he\u2019s playing Michael Jackson in the episode.
