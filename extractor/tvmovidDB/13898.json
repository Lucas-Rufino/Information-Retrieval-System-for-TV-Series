Therefore, this drama plans to show the viewers something more relatable - love that blooms in our everyday lives. This drama shows how a familiar relationship turns into a fluttering relationship, how a friendship suddenly turns into love, and how a once dull life suddenly becomes blinding due to love. This drama is about a man and a woman who have nothing more to share thanks to their completely different personalities. However, they have no idea whom they are in love with.
