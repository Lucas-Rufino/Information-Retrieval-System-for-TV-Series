  "resume": "Annika Bengtzon is a journalist and working mother of two struggling to keep her marriage alive. Fearless in her search for the truth, she won't take no for an answer from anyone: not from prestigious academicians, or drug dealers or from colleagues inside her own profession. Her passion for getting the story may bring her into dangerous situations, but it ultimately allows her to peer into the heart of every crime. Annika's not afraid to square off with hardened criminals, but her toughest challenge seems to be trying to balance the job with her sometimes tumultuous private life.",
