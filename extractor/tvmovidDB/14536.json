These fighting suits are powered by a powerful energy called \"aura\" or \"life energy.\" Certain people are strong enough with the aura-energy to act as power-supply to these mecha, making them Aura Warriors.\nThe series aired on Nagoya TV from February 5, 1983 to January 21, 1984, totaling for 49 episodes. There was a three episode anime OVA sequel, 'New Story of Aura Battler Dunbine released in 1988.\nThe series was later dubbed by ADV Films and was released to DVD in North America, along with the original Japanese version in 2003.",
