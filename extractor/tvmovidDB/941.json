View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  7 Featured Review A review by Reno  8.0 Written by  Reno  on September 26, 2017 She's just turned a teenager, and her personal life just got twisted! SEASON 01: The latest coming-of-age comedy-drama from Disney channel. 'Girls Meets World' left a big void and so far no programme had replaced it. Could this be the one? Well, I would say, almost. 12 episodes per season for a children's show is too short, even for a short as 20 minutes long per episode. But it was a good initiation. Not just focused on comedy, but so many inspiring topics as well. And then its central character, Andi was not the one who led the entire show. The best part was, all the character...  read the rest.
