  "resume": "Li Wei Young was born Princess Feng Xin Er, the third daughter of the proud royalty of the Northern Wei Dynasty. Although she never quite gets the affection of her family because she was born on a day deemed one of misfortune, Xin Er is pure of heart and sharp of mind. One fateful night, in a massacre rivaling few others, Xin Er\u2019s kingdom is annihilated. Escaping with her life but now an orphan, Xin Er accidentally wanders into enemy territory. There, she assumes the identity of her savior Li Wei Young, the daughter of a tutor. Full of hatred for the enemy that destroyed her kingdom and lacking in the feminine graces expected in her time, the somewhat arrogant Wei Young has trouble fitting in. But, being both wise and pure of heart, she ultimately learns to channel her hatred towards those who deserve it and become a kinder person overall. And it is exactly her wisdom and humanity that attracts towards her two very different men. Tuoba Jun is the beloved, well-educated, kind prince that is favored by all, including the king, and who falls in love with Wei Young. And competing with him is his younger brother Tuoba Yu, the cold, menacing and emotionally scarred prince that truly wants to rule the empire, and sees the intelligent Wei Young as his tool and his elder sibling as his rival. Wei Young, however, only has her eyes on one thing: she was not able to save her people. Between the schemes of these two men and living in enemy territory, can Wei Young ever avenge her kingdom?",
