  "resume": "Kocktails with Khlo\u00e9 raises the bar on the fun, surprising and real conversation that happens when friends get together at home to dish on their lives, pop culture, fashion, celebrity gossip and more. The series will reflect what Khlo\u00e9 does at her own home: hosting meals, sharing opinions and experiences, encouraging fun and honesty, and inviting friends to join the party. Taped in Los Angeles, the non-traditional set for Kocktails with Khlo\u00e9 is designed to replicate a true, intimate home environment; as such, it will feature a functional kitchen, dining area and living spaces \u2013 but it will not include a studio audience. In each episode, celebrity guests \u2013 including Khlo\u00e9's friends and family \u2013 will join her in the kitchen and around the table for a lively dinner party where engaging and relevant conversations will pair with cooking, party games and, of course, Kocktails. Adding to the elegant and fun party atmosphere will be Chef Sharone Hakman who will collaborate on menus and assist in entertaining.",
