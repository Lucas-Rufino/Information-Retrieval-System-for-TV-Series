Those who survive for 40 days filled with gut-wrenching journeys and demanding physical challenges will split the money as their prize. The catch? They can buy all of the survival supplies and creature comforts they desire, but everything is crazy expensive (think $30K for a tent), all decisions to make a purchase require a group majority and the cost comes out of their shared prize money.",
