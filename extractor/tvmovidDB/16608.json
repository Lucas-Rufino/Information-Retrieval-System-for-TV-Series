The show officially premiered on Sony Pictures Entertainment owned Crackle on January 6, 2010, but the first three episodes began streaming on December 23, 2009 to qualify for the Streamy Awards. The fact that this series, along with several others, were regionally geoblocked led to a controversy over eligibility for the Streamys because it was not made fully available on the World Wide Web. The controversy led to a ruling by the Streamys that geoblocked web series are eligible. The Bannen Way is a production of Sony Pictures Television. The executive producers are Mark Gantt and Jesse Warren. Gantt's co-stars are Vanessa Marcil, Gabriel Tigerman, Michael Ironside, and Robert Forster. New episodes were streamed weekdays through January 22, 2010. A season one DVD is in production. It is currently unknown if there will be a second season.",
