Rather than drinking blood from innocent strangers, he opts for blood sold on the black market in the posh bars of Seoul.

The only person who knows of his secret ability is Detective Hwang Soon Bum (Lee Won Jong). They end up working together in a new joint department between police and prosecutors solving murder cases. They are joined by rookie prosecutor Yoo Jung In (Lee Young Ah), and intern Cho Dong Man.
