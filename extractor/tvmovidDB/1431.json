Now she\u2019s his wife, and at just 32, he\u2019s somehow found himself with 14-year-old daughter Lily, two little boys, and a constant struggle between his need to be responsible and his desperate desire to be irresponsible. His judgmental father Walt and devil-may-care brother Eddie are no help at all. When they all get together, stories always start to fly. Of course, Sean\u2019s family will never let him finish a story; they interrupt, they debate, they derail, they defend themselves; just like any good family would.",
