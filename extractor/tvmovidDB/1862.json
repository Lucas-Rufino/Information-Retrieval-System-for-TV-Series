View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  10 G A review by Gimly  4.0 Written by  Gimly  on September 19, 2017 I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The fault may lie with me somewhat there, as I read the book first and had a certain level of expectation which I know never to do. But the rest of the responsibility I level straight at Tommy Lee Wallace and his film, which is just not that great. It does however, feature an astounding performance from the peerless Tim Curry as the piece's titular villain. Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product.
