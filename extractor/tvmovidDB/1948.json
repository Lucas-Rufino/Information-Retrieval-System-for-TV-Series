View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  2 A review by MagicMark  10.0 Written by  MagicMark  on May 27, 2017 I was born after the show had been off the air for a few years, so of course I discovered it in reruns.  It was syndicated all over the country by then, and locally it aired on Sunday nights at 6pm (a fairly wise strategy, since airing episodes once a week meant they wouldn't run through them too quickly). My father was a fan of the show, and we watched it together every Sunday evening after dinner. When we started this ritual I was too young to enjoy most of the shows my dad enjoyed, but this had everything I could want; good guys, bad guys, lots of action, inventive plots, gadgets, and...  read the rest.
