  "resume": "Two separate worlds lie on two sides of the road in a seaside town. Both too close and way too far from each other. What happens when two young people from these worlds fall in love?  Kemal is one of the three children of a moderate family that lives in one of the inner neighborhoods of the town. His hand to mouth world has pinned all hopes on him. The motive of this world is not high aims, it\u2019s to make a living and survive. It\u2019s Kemal\u2019s last year in mine engineering. His dreams are restricted with the truth and he doesn\u2019t believe in miracles. Especially in miracles like love.  Kemal is soon tested with his disbelief and Nihan hops into his monotonous life. After that day Kemal\u2019s world turns upside down and he loses control.  Nihan is the girl from the glamorous part of the town. She\u2019s distant to the values of her environment; she\u2019s actually distant to her own world. Kemal and Nihan\u2019s love is as distant as a poor guy and a rich girl. But their love ignores the distance between them and they somehow manage to stay together until the day that Kemal has to leave Istanbul to work in a mine. That day will be a crossroad for Kemal and Nihan, a moment of a tough decision.",
