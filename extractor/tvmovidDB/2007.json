  "resume": "Leina is walking outside of town when she encounters Melona, and tells her she is going to defeat her for attacking travellers. Melona taunts Leina for being such a weak fighter, and says she only wants to fight decent warriors as she is a participant in the Queen's Blade, a tournament held every four years to decide who is going to be the next Queen. Risty is watching the battle from the sidelines, and just as Melona is about to kill Leina, Risty intervenes and saves her life. Soon after, Nanael appears on the battlefield, hoping she found a potential battle, only to find the place deserted. Risty tends to Leina until she recovers and takes her as a prisoner back to Vance Castle to recover the bounty on her head. When Risty arrives at the castle, Claudette appears and arrests Risty for being a thief and imprisons her in the castle's dungeon. However, Risty escapes and steals the Vance Family's heirloom breastplate. She hides in Leina's room and gives Leina the armor, then leaves, encountering Claudette outside and they fight. Meanwhile, Melona appears at Leina's window. They fight, and Leina defeats Melona by stopping her from shooting acid from her breasts, causing her to explode.",
