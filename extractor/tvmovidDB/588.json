It's not perfect, but it's exciting, fun, witty, creative, and quirky. The best way to watch is with an open mind and with (preferably) a good episode. Sometimes it can get cheesy or too silly, but as whole it's an amazing show. Series 11 starts next year with Chris Chibnall as the new showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the new Doctor, and it's gonna be fantastic. \nGod bless Doctor Who!
