  "resume": "Armored Trooper VOTOMS is a 52-episode anime television series, created by Ryosuke Takahashi, Sunrise and Tatsunoko Production, and produced by Tatsunoko's Kenji Yoshida, featuring mechanical designs by Kunio Okawara. The series originally aired in Japan from April 1, 1983 to March 23, 1984 on TV Tokyo. Following directly in the footsteps of Takahashi's previous hit series, Fang of the Sun Dougram, VOTOMS continued the trend towards hard science in the mecha anime sub-genre. The televised series focuses on the story of stoic Armored Trooper pilot Chirico Cuvie and his quest for answers after a sudden betrayal leaves him on the run from his own military. The series was supplemented by numerous original video animation releases, and also inspired a number of spin-off works whose media ranges from serialized light novels to video games.",
