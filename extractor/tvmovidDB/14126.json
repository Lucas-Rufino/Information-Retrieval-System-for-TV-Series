View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  0 A review by Bricktop  1.0 Written by  Bricktop  on January  2, 2018 Just watched a random episode of this. Wow. It's literally just the full episode of Ancient Aliens in the background with superimposed Bronson & crew smoking, eating, getting shaved and talking about things trivial and unrelated. I would rather watch static than this horrible shit even though I like Ancient Aliens and Action Bronson and weed for that matter. These things just don't stack up to anything at all. Half a star seems like a generous donation. Easily the single worst video I've ever seen and I've seen two girls, one cup. At least that video had an idea.
