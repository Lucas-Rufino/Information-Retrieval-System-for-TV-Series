It was aired in Japan as a separate rebooted transformers series, though in America, the English dub was presented as a sequel to the previous series, Transformers: Armada and Transformers: Energon by adding dialogue and reusing a number of screens to link elements of the Armada and Energon series to the show, giving the impression that it is a sequel. In the anime, all of the Transformers are computer-generated, while the humans and backgrounds are rendered in traditional cel animation.
