It centers around the adventures and tribulations of the title character, El Chavo \u2014 a poor orphan played by the show's creator, Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os, and other inhabitants of a fictional housing complex, or, as called in Spanish, vecindad.\nThe show traces back to May 1972, where it appeared as a sketch in the \"Chespirito\" show, produced by \"Televisi\u00f3n Independiente de Mexico\", broadcast on Mexico's Canal 8, XHTIM-TV. In 1975, El Chavo moved to Televisa and became a weekly half-hour series. The show was cancelled in 1980, but shorts were still produced in Chespirito from that year until 1992. At its peak of popularity during the mid-1970s, El Chavo, having 350 million viewers worldwide, was the most watched show in Mexican television.\nThe frequent occurrence of Mexican idiomatic expressions makes El Chavo del Ocho very hard to translate into other languages, save for Portuguese which is similar to Spanish. Theme music for the series was \"The Elephant Never Forgets\", a playful version of Beethoven's \"Turkish March\" in 1967 by electronic music pioneers Perrey and Kingsley.",
