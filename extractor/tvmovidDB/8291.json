An anime adaptation runs on TV Tokyo's anime satellite channel, AT-X. A second \"season\" of the manga, named: Amaenaideyo!! MS! was released 3 years later.\nThe second season of the anime, Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!!, was shortly released and introduces a new antagonist character, the fifteen-year-old girl, Kazusano Kazuki who is actually very affectionate to Ikkou, unlike the other girls. The second season is also more serious and dramatic than the last one, and focuses more on Hinata's unstable powers, Haruka's childhood years and Kazuki's tricks to get her hand on Ikkou's powers.\nThe show was broadcast in Japan with an R-15 rating, which is the Japanese equivalent of a 'Restricted' rating. Media Blasters licensed and released both seasons of the anime in North America under the title Ah My Buddha, first as six single bilingual DVD volumes throughout 2009, and then as a six-DVD collection in April 2010.",
