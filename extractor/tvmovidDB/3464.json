View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  0 T A review by Thomaxz  1.0 Written by  Thomaxz  on March 12, 2017 Watch every other incarnation of Scooby Doo!!!\nEven Scooby Doo and 13 Ghost, which was weird, is still 1000 times better than this. Like Velma beliving in \"Early piratetism\", are f--k--g kidding me, so stupid. Do not see this!! Instead  go watch any other Scooby Doo.
