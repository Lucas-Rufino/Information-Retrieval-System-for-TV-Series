View All Seasons Social Reviews  1 Discussions  0 G A review by Gimly  2.0 Written by  Gimly  on April  4, 2017 A bizarre Marvel/LEGO skitshow with seemingly no point or original content. I don't expect much from this sort of thing (advertising material) but even for the format this was particularly odd. Final rating:\u2605 - Of no value.
