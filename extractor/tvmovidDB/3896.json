  "resume": "Some guys have no luck; he\u2019s got no pulse. That\u2019s life for poor unfortunate, undead Ayumu. First, he was murdered by a serial killer. Total bummer. Then he was resurrected as a zombie by a cute little Necromancer. That seemed pretty cool until she moved into his house, refused to speak, and forced his rotting carcass to do all the cooking. After that, a magical girl in a pretty pink dress used her matching chainsaw to chop his corpse in half. Luckily, the Necromancer\u2019s powers of resurrection trumped those of the chainsaw chick, so instead of dying (again), Ayumu became the world\u2019s first magical girl zombie. There\u2019s also a voluptuous vampire ninja who thinks zombie boy\u2019s a pervert \u2013 and a hideous crayfish demon who wants to devour him. Confused? All you gotta know is this: zombies, frilly dresses, demons, and moe chainsaws. Pink. It\u2019s the new dead.",
